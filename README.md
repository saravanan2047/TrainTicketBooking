# Train Booking System

## Overview

The **Train Booking System** is a Java console application designed to manage train reservations. This system allows users to book tickets, cancel reservations, and view train schedules and booking details. It is designed to facilitate smooth and efficient handling of train ticketing operations.

## Features

### 1. Ticket Booking
- **Book Tickets**: Allows users to book train tickets by selecting the train, date, and number of seats.
- **View Booking Details**: Users can view details of their bookings including train details, booking status, and seat information.
- **Cancel Tickets**: Users can cancel their booked tickets and the system updates the availability accordingly.

### 2. Train Schedule Management
- **Add Train Schedules**: Administrators can add new train schedules to the system.
- **View Train Schedules**: Users can view the schedules of different trains including departure and arrival times.
- **Update Train Schedules**: Administrators can update the schedules of existing trains.

### 3. User Management
- **Add New Users**: Allows adding new users to the system with details such as name, contact information, and user ID.
- **View User Details**: Administrators can view details of all users registered in the system.
- **Update User Information**: Users can update their personal information.

## Design Patterns Used

### 1. Singleton Pattern
- **BookingManager Class**: Ensures that only one instance of the BookingManager exists to manage all bookings efficiently.

### 2. Factory Pattern
- **TicketFactory Class**: Used to create different types of tickets based on user requirements and preferences.

### 3. Observer Pattern
- **Notification System**: Implements the observer pattern to notify users about booking confirmations, cancellations, and schedule changes.

## Data Structures Used

### 1. ArrayList
- Used to maintain dynamic lists of trains, users, and bookings.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

### 1. Classes and Objects
- **Train Class**: Represents individual train details including schedule and availability.
- **User Class**: Represents users with personal information and booking history.
- **Booking Class**: Represents booking details including train, user, and seat information.

### 2. Encapsulation
- Data fields in classes like `Train`, `User`, and `Booking` are encapsulated and accessed via getter and setter methods.

### 3. Inheritance
- **User Types**: Different types of users (e.g., regular user, administrator) can be handled through inheritance.

### 4. Polymorphism
- Methods in the `Booking` class can be overridden in subclasses to provide specific functionality for different types of bookings.

### 5. Abstraction
- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**: Used to define abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring a consistent interface.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the Program**: Use the following command to compile the Java program:
    ```bash
    javac TrainBookingSystem.java
    ```

2. **Run the Program**: Use the following command to run the compiled Java program:
    ```bash
    java TrainBookingSystem
    ```

## Usage

1. **Book a Ticket**: Follow the prompts to select the train, date, and number of seats.
2. **Cancel a Ticket**: Enter the booking ID to cancel a ticket.
3. **View Train Schedules**: Display the list of all train schedules with details.
4. **Add a Train Schedule**: Enter the train details including departure and arrival times to add a new schedule.
5. **Update User Information**: Modify personal information such as contact details.

## Code Structure

- **TrainBookingSystem.java**: The main file containing the implementation of the train booking system operations.
  - **BookingManager Class**: Manages the creation and updating of bookings.
  - **UserManager Class**: Manages user information and updates.
  - **ScheduleManager Class**: Handles the scheduling and updating of train schedules.
  - **Main Class**: Facilitates user interaction and handles menu options.

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure that JDK is installed on your system to compile and run the program.
